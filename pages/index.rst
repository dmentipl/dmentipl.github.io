Research
--------

I work with `Daniel Price
<https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/daniel-price>`_ and `Christophe Pinte
<https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/christophe-pinte>`_ on hydrodynamical
and radiative transfer modelling of protoplanetary discs.

We perform global dust-gas smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of
protoplanetary discs with embedded planets using `Phantom
<http://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/>`_, and post-process these simulations with the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code `MCFOST
<http://ipag-old.osug.fr/~pintec/mcfost/docs/html/overview.html>`_.

I have applied these techniques, for example, to model the `disc around TW Hya
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484L.130M/abstract>`_, and to study
the effect of `stellar flybys
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.4114C/abstract>`_ on
`protoplanetary discs
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..504C/abstract>`_ in work led
by `Nicolas Cuello <https://cuellonicolas.wixsite.com/astrophysics>`_.

Code
----

I am the main author of `Plonk <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk>`_, a smoothed
particle hydrodynamics analysis and visualization tool written in Python. See
the paper at `JOSS <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01884#>`_.

Other packages for working with Phantom in Python include:

* `phantom-config <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-config>`_ — read and
  write Phantom configuration files,
* `phantom-setup <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-setup>`_ — generate
  initial conditions for Phantom simulations,
* `phantom-build <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-build>`_ — make compiling
  Phantom easier.

In addition, I contribute code to Phantom and MCFOST, both written in modern
Fortran, and `pymcfost <https://github.com/cpinte/pymcfost>`_, a Python package
for analysis and visualization of MCFOST output.
