About
-----

I'm a PhD student at the School of Physics and Astronomy at Monash University.

I work with Daniel Price and Christophe Pinte on hydrodynamical and radiative
transfer modelling of protoplanetary discs, using
`Phantom <http://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/>`_ and
`MCFOST <http://ipag-old.osug.fr/~pintec/mcfost/docs/html/overview.html>`_.

Code
----

I am the main author of `Plonk <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk>`_, a smoothed
particle hydrodynamics analysis and visualization tool written in Python.

In addition, I contribute to both Phantom and MCFOST.

Other packages for working with Phantom include:

* `phantom-config <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-config>`_ for working
  with Phantom configuration files,
* `phantom-setup <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-setup>`_ for generating
  initial conditions for Phantom simulations,
* `phantom-build <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-build>`_ to make it easier
  to compile Phantom.
