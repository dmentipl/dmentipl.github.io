About
-----

I am a computational astrophysics PhD student at the School of Physics and
Astronomy at Monash University. I use numerical simulations to study
`protoplanetary discs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk>`__, the
birthplace of planets. I also write open source scientific software.

Research
--------

I work with `Daniel Price
<https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/daniel-price>`__ and `Christophe Pinte
<https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/christophe-pinte>`__ on hydrodynamical
and radiative transfer modelling of protoplanetary discs.

We perform global dust-gas smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of
protoplanetary discs with embedded planets using `Phantom
<http://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/>`__, and post-process these simulations with
the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code `MCFOST
<http://ipag.osug.fr/~pintec/mcfost/docs/html/overview.html>`__.

Publications
------------

I have applied these techniques, for example, to model the `disc around TW Hya
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484L.130M/abstract>`__, and to
study the effect of `stellar flybys
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.4114C/abstract>`__ on
`protoplanetary discs
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..504C/abstract>`__ in work led
by `Nicolas Cuello <https://cuellonicolas.wixsite.com/astrophysics>`__.

My full publication list is available on
`ORCID <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5526-8798>`__.

Data
----

I make datasets relating to my work available on `figshare
<https://figshare.com/authors/Daniel_Mentiplay/7505300>`__.

Of particular interest may be the two datasets relating to the TW Hya work: one
contains output from `Phantom models
<https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TW_Hya_dust_and_gas_hydrodynamical_models_with_Phantom/11595369>`__,
and the other contains output from `MCFOST post-processed models
<https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TW_Hya_dust_and_gas_radiative_transfer_models_with_MCFOST/11625930>`__.

Software
--------

I write software in Python and (modern) Fortran.

For example, I am the main author of `Plonk
<https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk>`__, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics
analysis and visualization tool written in Python. See the paper at `JOSS
<https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01884#>`__.

Other Python packages for working with Phantom that I have written include:

* `phantom-config <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-config>`__ — read,
  modify, convert, and write Phantom configuration files;
* `phantom-build <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-build>`__ — make it easy
  to generate reproducible Phantom builds for writing reproducible papers;
* `phantom-setup <https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-setup>`__ — generate
  initial conditions for Phantom simulations (️this is a work in progress).

I also contribute code to Phantom and MCFOST, both written in modern
Fortran, and to `pymcfost <https://github.com/cpinte/pymcfost>`__, a Python
package for analysis and visualization of MCFOST output.

See my `GitHub profile <https://github.com/dmentipl>`__ for all my open source
software projects. You may find my public `dotfiles
<https://github.com/dmentipl/dotfiles>`__ for setting up a macOS machine from
scratch useful.
