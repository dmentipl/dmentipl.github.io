## About

I am a research scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, working on post-processing numerical weather prediction data within the [IMPROVER](https://github.com/metoppv/improver) collaboration.

I have a PhD in astrophysics from Monash University, where I worked with Daniel Price and Christophe Pinte using numerical simulations to study protoplanetary discs, the birthplace of planets.

I'm interested in science, software, and combining them in reproducible and open scientific software development. I have extensive experience in writing scientific software in Python and Fortran.

## Software

Lead developer denoted by (*).

- [IMPROVER](https://github.com/metoppv/improver) is a library of algorithms for meteorological post-processing and verification
- [MCFOST](https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost) is a 3D continuum and line radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method (plus ray-tracing)
- [Phantom](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom) is a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics code for astrophysics
- [phantom-build](https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-build) is designed to make building Phantom easier (*)
- [phantom-config](https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-config) parse, convert, modify, and generate Phantom config files (*)
- [Plonk](https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk) is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics (*)
- [sph-interp](https://github.com/dmentipl/sph-interp) smoothed particle hydrodynamics interpolation to a grid (*)
