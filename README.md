# Daniel Mentiplay (dmentipl)

My personal website and blog, available at [https://dmentipl.github.io](https://dmentipl.github.io), written in markdown and generated by Sphinx.

## Usage

Instructions for installing and building the website locally.

### Install

Install dependencies. For example in a conda environment.

```bash
conda create --name website python pip
conda activate website
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build

Make changes then build the HTML with Sphinx.

```bash
make dirhtml
```

### View

Inspect the output in a web browser.

```bash
open _build/dirhtml/index.html
```

### Deploy

A GitHub Actions workflow is used to deploy website. Any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically rebuild the website.

See [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for details.

## Requirements

The website is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/), and [MyST](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) using the [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/).

## Credit

This work is modified from Chris Holdgraf's [website and blog](https://predictablynoisy.com/). The source for his website is available on GitHub at [choldgraf/choldgraf.github.io](https://github.com/choldgraf/choldgraf.github.io).
