Research
========

I have worked with [Daniel Price](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/daniel-price) and [Christophe Pinte](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/christophe-pinte) on hydrodynamical and radiative transfer modelling of protoplanetary discs.

We performed global dust-gas smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded planets using [Phantom](http://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/), and post-process these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code [MCFOST](http://ipag.osug.fr/~pintec/mcfost/docs/html/overview.html).

Publications
------------

I have applied these techniques, for example, to model the [disc around TW Hya](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484L.130M/abstract), and to study the effect of [stellar flybys](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.4114C/abstract) on [protoplanetary discs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..504C/abstract) in work led by [Nicolas Cuello](https://cuellonicolas.wixsite.com/astrophysics). I also developed and tested a method to model [multiple dust species in SPH](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3806M/abstract).

Data
----

I have made datasets relating to my work available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/authors/Daniel_Mentiplay/7505300).

Of particular interest may be the two datasets relating to the TW Hya work: one contains output from [Phantom models](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TW_Hya_dust_and_gas_hydrodynamical_models_with_Phantom/11595369), and the other contains output from [MCFOST post-processed models](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TW_Hya_dust_and_gas_radiative_transfer_models_with_MCFOST/11625930).
