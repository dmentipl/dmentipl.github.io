About
=====

My name is Daniel Mentiplay. I work at the Bureau of Meteorology as a data scientist and software developer with a focus on post-processing numerical weather prediction [NWP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction) data.

I completed my PhD in astrophysics at the School of Physics and Astronomy at Monash University, where I used numerical simulations to study [protoplanetary discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk), the birthplace of planets.

I like to write open source scientific software in Python, Julia, and Fortran.
