Software
========

I write software in Python, Julia, and (modern) Fortran.

For example, I am the main author of [Plonk](https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk), a smoothed particle hydrodynamics analysis and visualization tool written in Python. See the paper at [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01884#).

Other Python packages for working with Phantom that I have written include:

* [phantom-config](https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-config) — read, modify, convert, and write Phantom configuration files;
* [phantom-build](https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-build) — make it easy to generate reproducible Phantom builds for writing reproducible papers;
* [phantom-setup](https://github.com/dmentipl/phantom-setup) — generate initial conditions for Phantom simulations (️this is a work in progress).

I also contribute code to Phantom and MCFOST, both written in modern Fortran, and to [pymcfost](https://github.com/cpinte/pymcfost), a Python package for analysis and visualization of MCFOST output.

See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dmentipl) for all my open source software projects. You may find my public [dotfiles](https://github.com/dmentipl/dotfiles) for setting up a macOS/Linux machine from scratch useful.
